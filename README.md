# The Pi3 AR DRone controller

This is a projet to control an AR Drone v1.0 with a raspberry Pi3 via a web browser on yet a 3rd computer. The purpose of this was to eventually move the Pi
onto the Drone and add things to the drone that it currently does not support such as multiple cameras, multiple sonar, GPS and others.
While the AR drone probably cannot lift all this hardware anyway I just wanted to learn and fool around.
